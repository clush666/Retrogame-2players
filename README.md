Retrogame-2players
==================

Raspberry Pi GPIO-to-USB utility for classic game emulators for 2 players (23 GPIO needed). It is highly based on the Adafruit-Retrogame https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Retrogame.

Our modifications allow to get up to 25 GPIO for buttons and Joystick micro-switchs.
